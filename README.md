 ###### The default `newtab` page styling ⦁ Working on Chrome v62.0.3202 ⦁ Open source

This module has been created for developers who are willing to make themes/extensions for Google Chrome that modifies the default newtab page `chome://newtab`. You can add your custom styling/JS to tweak the newtab page. e.g. hiding the most visited tiles, decorating the search bar, replacing the Google logo with whatever you like and so on.

## Preface
There was a lot of modules for tweaking the newtab page and all of them stopped working up until several months ago because of the change of `chrome://newtab` behaviour. However, I tried to find a way to bypass that and came up with this module that will let to you customize the default `newtab` page like before.

*You can use this as an extension right now using Chrome's extension developer mode.*
